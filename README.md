## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

Decided to change my original idea of using my project 
3 wallpaper idea to creating a pattern of what looks to 
me like rows of flowers. The "petals" grow and contract 
to different sizes randomly. 

Each stage changes the flowers slightly from colours to 
shape. I really like that way it is starting to work out 
with the map and zoom functions, I think the final result 
will be quite interesting.

Every second zoom in changes what is shown. The colour 
changes, the speed of the animation changes, so does the 
opacity and the distance each circle "petal" is from the 
inner circle.
